# About
An experienced technical author and trainer used to different versions of application software, operating systems, and bespoke systems on both IPAD and PC.  Very confident working in a strategic and proactive manner to achieve innovative solutions and a keen eye for spotting inconsistencies and problems and thinking of ways to resolve them. An excellent team player who can diplomatically and proactively work with all levels within an organisation.

# Documentation Examples
All work that I have created is confidential, but I have uploaded a sample selection for perusal.  I have used the same template to show a consistent theme, but any template style can be used. All work has been redacted where necessary.
